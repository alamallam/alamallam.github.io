This is my homepage and blog. I try to make this blog mostly about interesting or perhaps even important knowledge or events which I happen to come in contact with.

Furthermore this website contains a repository for information on projects I am, or have been working on, usually containing a more personal look on the project, why I perhaps started/joined it or how I feel the development is going.

All pages on this site are written in Markdown using Jekyll for building and hosted on Github Pages. All this is open source software and free services that I wholeheartedly recommend.
